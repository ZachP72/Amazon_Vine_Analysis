# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview 
* The goal for this project was to take a data set from Amazon reviews and use PySpark to perform ETL and connect it to a data base in an AWS data server. The reviews I picked were on the topic of Video Games and it was my goal to determine if Vine members had a favorable review bias by using the data set provided.

## Results:
### Number of Vine and non-Vine Reviews
* In this data there were 44,762 overall reviews in which 4,291 were vine reviews and 40,471 non-vine reviews.
* Of the 15711 5-star reviews, only 6001 were vine reviews. 
* 38.2% of the 5-star reviews were Vine.
* 38.9% of the 5-star reviews were non-Vine.

## Summary:
* It appears that after the numbers were crunched that vine and non-vine percentages seem to be around 38%-39% with little margin. This would then conclude that there is no bias within the vine program.
